        	<p>As being student of software engineering. We have module named “web development”. In this module we learn about the web like how does web works ,what is web and how to develop web. As a beginner it was quite difficult to work. At first I felt so difficult while learning. By my experience I feel easy when tutor shows us by using different tag and syntax in class. But when I start doing things by myself I feel so difficult. By which I learned that in “web development” we need to practice as much as we can. Practice is only thing that makes us easy to work on web development. If we practice a lot by researching on internet we can be very good at it. In internet we found many learning material and university’s learning material is also quite good and also also quite easy.</p>

                <p>We have learned almost couple of month so , we got our first assignment where we have to build a web page which consist of pages like home page, portfolio, blog, contact and site report. At first I roughly design the structure in paper.I felt easy in the beginning while I was just designing outline only.
But later on I felt difficult while designing the content in pages.</p>

	<p>
I Started designing different section with different font syntax and color in css. At last I figured out the design which is suitable for me.</p>
<p>
And another important things while designing web pages is validation . so I have done validation using this website "validator.w3.org"
</p>
<div class="validation-container">
	<img src="vald-home.jpg" alt="validation of page">home page
	<img src="vald-blog.jpg"  alt="validation of page">Blog page
	<img src="vald-contact.jpg" alt="validation of page">Contact page
	<img src="vald-report.jpg" alt="validation of page">Report page
	<img src="vald-css.jpg" alt="validation of page">CSS page
	<img src="vald-portfolio.jpg" alt="validation of page">portfolio page
</div>
        </div>
       <div><p>as we can see there is photo of code validation.</p>
       	<p>while designing the design of my webpage i get highly inspired from https://nile.northampton.ac.uk/ultra/  .And i uses code from learning material provided by university</p></div>
